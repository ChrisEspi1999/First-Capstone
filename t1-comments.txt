- Overall, great job!

- Minor cleanup issues with unused commented out code and unused
imports.

- Rename the getChange class. This sounds too much like the name
of a method. Class names are supposed to be capitalized. You 
could go for something like "ChangeMaker" or "ChangeDispenser".

On that note, this class could have also had a property to record
how much money has been fed in, as opposed to having the CLI
store this information.
